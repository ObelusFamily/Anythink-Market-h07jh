# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_
Since I don't remember the details, I will just mention the parts I remember.

First of all, after installing docker -which you'll need to do for installing the necessary containers- you'll also need to install a linux kernel. But don't worry, because docker warns you if you don't have the kernel and directs you to the web site in which you'll have the instructions for downloading a linux kernel. At this stage, you just need to follow the instructions. 

Then, you can just follow the steps that are given in Anythink. A command will be given you to check whether the docker is installed properly or not. After you see that it is working, you will open your kernel, with using cd command, you will get to the directory where your cloned git link is. Then you will run the command. Don't worry much if it takes around 5-10 seconds and if you see that 5-7 gb of your memory is filled suddenly.

And when you are done with these, you should be able to enter to the first localhost, and then the actual site.
